            <h1>Tokyo, the Eastern Capital</h1>
            <p>
              Located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central
              Honshu. It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called
              Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in
              Japan. Tokyo's population exceeded one million in the late 19th
              century, and as Japan's political, economic, and cultural centre
              it became one of the world's most populous cities in the 20th
              century. The city is built on low, alluvial plains and adjacent
              upland hills. The climate is mild in winter and hot and humid in
              the summer. Early summer and early autumn are rainy seasons; two
              or three typhoons usually occur during September and October.
